# Water Level Monitoring System

## Experiment Conclusion

From the experiments conducted during the development of this Water Level Monitoring System, the following conclusions were drawn:

- **Ping Experiment**: Comparing experiments between pings without using a timer and with a timer, it was observed that longer delays resulted in more accurate sensor readings of the water level.
- **Water Container Experiment**: During working mode, it was noted that when the pump transitions from running to stopped, there is an error in reading the water level due to surface irregularities caused by water flow.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity Experiment**: The Microcontroller ESP32 can successfully connect to Wi-Fi networks using security protocols such as WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK, and WEP.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: The ultrasonic sensor demonstrated suitability for water monitoring with an error threshold of 2 cm.

## Future Goals

- **Enhanced Sensor Accuracy**: Future iterations will focus on improving the accuracy and waterproofing of the ultrasonic sensor to ensure reliable performance in various conditions.
- **Industrial Tank Monitoring**: The project aims to expand its application to monitor and control industrial tanks, such as chemical tanks. This will involve using more robust controllers like PLCs and flexible sensors.
- **Data Management**: Currently, collected data is stored temporarily on a server. Future plans involve implementing a permanent storage solution, enabling historical tracking and real-time analysis for improved product monitoring and management.
